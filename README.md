# My Personal Website
A very responsive and good looking website to showcase me and my skills.

## Setup
The website is live at https://fireplank.xyz for people only wanting to check it out.
<br/><br/>
If you want to build from source all you have to do is clone the repo, and inside the folder type `npm install` and then you can run it in dev mode by running `npm run dev` 
<br/>
The site will be live at http://localhost:3000

## Contribution and Feedback
I currently am not planning on accepting pull requests as it's my own portfolio and I feel I should be the one doing it. I do however accept issues about stuff that I can improve uppon and any suggestions about my website.
